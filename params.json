The Centre for the Investigation of Canadian War Crimes is dedicated to investigating the war criminals who work for CSE and CSIS and bringing them to justice under international law.\r\n\r\n### Nuremberg 2.0\r\nLike the Eli Wiesenthal Centre, that dedicates itself to hunting down Nazi war criminals, the Centre for the Investigation of Canadian War Criminals will build dossiers on the war criminals who work for the Canadian secret police, and work under the constraints of international law to bring them to justice at The Hague.\r\n\r\n### Funding Sought\r\nThe Centre for the Investigation of Canadian War Crimes seeks funding to pursue its work. Until Canadian war criminals are brought to justice, Canada continues to groan under the weight of their tyranny. Only be exposing and destroying their crimes against humanity will Canada ever enjoy a free and democratic society once more.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nTheCentreForTheInvestigationOf@CanadianWarCrimes.ca",
