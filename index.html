<p>Canada's secret police are guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Centre for the Investigation of Canadian War Crimes is dedicated to investigating the war criminals who work for CSE and CSIS and bringing them to justice under international law.</p>

<p>Like the Eli Wiesenthal Centre, which dedicates itself to hunting down Nazi war criminals, the Centre for the Investigation of Canadian War Criminals will build dossiers on the war criminals who work for the Canadian secret police, and work under the constraints of international law to bring them to justice at The Hague.</p>

<p>These war criminals must be charged in open court with their crimes, given full due process under international law, and then convicted, imprisoned, and, if so sentenced by the International Criminal Court, publicly executed for their crimes against humanity.</p>

<a id="funding-sought" class="anchor" href="#funding-sought" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Funding Sought</h3>

<p>The Centre for the Investigation of Canadian War Crimes seeks funding to pursue its work. Until Canadian war criminals are brought to justice, Canada will continue to groan under the weight of their tyranny. Only be exposing their crimes against humanity will Canada ever enjoy a free and democratic society once more.</p>
